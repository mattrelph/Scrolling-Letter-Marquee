      <marquee scrolldelay="35" direction = "up"><div> Well, Pa was said to have been borned on the Atlantic Ocean, March 20, 1836.   He crossed that twice.  He was supposed to have been borned on the Atlantic Ocean to a French mother who left him a sick baby, with the Schoonover family, while she (the French mother) was called back across the ocean.  When she sent for this boy later, she was informed that he had died.  She was married to an English man.  His name was Oliver.<br/><br/>

<span style="underline">When Pa was 21, he left the Schoonovers who had raised him and he hunted the Olivers up.  They thought first he was an imposter.  However he had a peculiar birthmark, the birth mark of the Olivers so finally they believed him and took him in.  But they were wine merchants and had an older son, who in England, rules.  Anyway Pa didn't like the liquor business, so he crossed back over to New York and married and settled down there.<br/><br/>

<span style="underline">That birthmark was a round white hair on the back of his head among the dark brown.  He had that all his life.  Of course Mother Schoonover said he was as much hers as any of the others.  But Pa said he had often wondered why the old man Schoonover gave the others good schooling, clothes and money and was so close with him.<br/><br/>

<span style="underline">And another thing.  Him and Louisa were the same age but not twins. (Louisa was a Schoonover girl who later rooked Pa out of his dead wife's rings and brooches and trinkets).  Maybe Pa took the place of a dead twin.  Well, I guess you had heard this before, so I hope it's no shock.  I think Mother Schoonover was good to Pa but the old man Schoonover used to go on terrific drunks once a year and would light his pipe with a rolled up $500 bill.  Some old gent, eh?  Well Pa couldn't stand that, so he got out and done for himself after he was 21.  Glad he was able to.<br/><br/>
